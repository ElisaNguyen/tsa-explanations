# Temporal Spike Attribution - A local feature-based explanation for Spiking Neural Networks

This repository contains the Python code for Temporal Spike Attribution (TSA), a method to extract 
feature attribution explanations for temporally coded Spiking Neural Network. 
TSA is demonstrated on a time-series classification use case with SNN models built as recurrent networks in discrete 
time [^1]
